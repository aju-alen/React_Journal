        abstract: `The purpose of this research paper is to present a critical evaluation of the higher education inspection policy of
        the UAE in juxtaposition with international best practices. The methodology adopted to facilitate the attainment of
        the foregoing purpose is qualitative document analysis. The research paper is therefore a theoretical research
        seeking to analyze the current policy in terms of its text, context and its consequence to determine its adherence
        with similar international policies. The findings of the study reveal that there is a gap in terms of the uniformity of
        inspection policy. This gap is also evident across the entire process of licensing and accreditation exercabated by
        the administrative nature of the UAE whereby individual Emirates have semi-autonomous educational regulatory
        bodies. The implications of the findings are that, it is incumbent upon the relevant authorities in the UAE, to work
        with leadership of higher educational institutions to regularise the inspection framework and make it standard across
        all the institutions and Emirates. This policy analysis research paper is a great contribution to higher education
        leadership and policy development in the UAE as it promotes clarity in terms of the need for uniformity of policy
        and framework for inspection across the UAE.`,

        abstract: `The purpose of this research paper is to present a critical evaluation of the assessment of adult learners in technical
        and vocational education training institutions (TVETs) in Dubai to determine their efficacy. The methodology
        adopted to facilitate the attainment of the foregoing purpose is qualitative document analysis. The research paper
        therefore seeks to analyze the current state of assessment in TVET institutions in Dubai and determine their
        effectiveness as far as producing market fit professionals is concerned. The findings of the study reveal that there
        are glaring gaps in the management of technical and vocation education and training institutions in Dubai. This gap
        has led to a low preference of TVET institutions and low uptake of programs in these institutions. The implications
        of the findings are that there is an urgent need to regularise the TVET landscape and develop uniformity in terms
        of operationalisation and assessment in these institutions. This qualitative review of the state of assessment in
        technical and vocation education and training institutions in Dubai contributes greatly to improving andragogy in
        Dubai and the UAE in general.`,

        abstract: `The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact of privatization in the Abu Dhabi tourism sector on the
        economic growth of Abu Dhabi. The methodology adopted to facilitate the foregoing is quantitative research
        supported by a questionnaire survey. Data was collected from over 300 experts in the tourism industry in Abu Dhabi
        and analyzed based on statistical measures to determine the impact of privatization on economic growth in Abu Dhabi.
        The findings of the study revealed that through privatization, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi tourism industry was able to
        benefit from increased efficiency, better service offerings and consequently increased revenues. These in turn led to
        increase in economic activities for other related sectors and a general spur in the economic buoyance of the Emirate.
        The implications of the findings are that it is incumbent upon the authorities in the Abu Dhabi commerce and tourism
        sector to encourage more privatization or partnerships with the private sector in order to enhance the economic
        viability of their vast investments in tourism and tourism attraction sites both natural and manmade. This research
        report plays a contributory role in demystifying privatization and its impact in the economy in the case of Abu Dhabi.`,

        prevalence of overweight/obesity in children and adolescents reporting a recent fracture in
        relation to gender, dynamic of trauma, and site of fracture.
        Four-hundred-forty-nine children and adolescents with fracture and 130 fracture-free controls
        were recruited from a large children’s hospital. The interaction between overweight and gender,
        dynamic of trauma, site of fracture was explored. Sports participation, television viewing, and
        calcium intake were also investigated.
        Overweight/obesity rate was increased in girls with fracture either at the upper or the lower limb
        (p= 0.004), while it was increased only in boys with fracture at the lower limb (p <0.02).
        Overweight/obesity rate did not differ between groups with low or moderate trauma. TV viewing
        ≥ 2 hrs was more frequent in children with fractures than controls (61.5% vs 34.5%, p =0.015) in
        the overweight/obese group.
        The increased prevalence of overweight/obesity in children with fractures is related to gender
        and site of fracture. Higher levels of sedentary behaviours characterize overweight children
        reporting fractures.`,

        abstract: `The current systematic investigation seeks to critically examine the role of physiotherapy in the
        rehabilitation of common occuring breast cancer related secondary lymphedema (BRCL) post
        treatment.
        Using Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane and PubMed databases, a systematic longitudinal
        research for the period between 2000 and 2020 was conducted. The goal of the examination of
        previous evidence was to analyze BCRL rehabilitation measures undertaken by medical
        institutions and professionals with clear assessment of Levels of Evidence (LoEs) in line with
        PRISMA statement.
        A total of 158 women in post breast cancer treatment were included in the study from a total of
        13 randomized control trials (RCTs). The article inclusion criterion was ‘physiotherapy as an
        intervention measure’ for post breast cancer treatment patients. The articles were found to
        include multiple physiotherapeutic regimens including swimming, yoga, resistance exercise,
        aerobics, aqua lymph training and gravity resistance exercise.
        The overall findings of the analysis of the multiple evidences of application of physiotherapy for
        rehabilitation of BRCL is that it significantly helps in improving the quality of life and plays a
        significant role also in improving objective and subjective parameters among the patients.`,

        title:"Conflict of Interest",
        content:"The existence of a conflict of interest (COI) arises when an individual’s private interests, which are in competition with their responsibilities to scientific and publishing activities, create a divergence. This divergence may lead a reasonable observer to question whether the individual’s behaviour or judgement was influenced by their competing interests. In accordance with the guidelines set forth by the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME), authors are required to disclose all financial or relevant interests that may have influenced the development of their manuscript. Reviewers are also expected to disclose any conflicts of interest and, if necessary, decline to review any manuscript that may have a conflict of interest, and such manuscripts will be reassigned to other editors. Additional resources on the topic of conflict of interest can also be found in the flowcharts provided by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the Conflicts of Interest guidelines established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), and the International Ethical Principles for Scholarly Publication developed by the International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM)."

The two versions will be linked, and a statement explaining the reason for the major change will be included. Retraction of articles will be carried out in accordance with the COPE retraction guidelines when necessary. For further information on scientific misconduct, expressions of concern, and retraction, readers may refer to the ICMJE guidelines.
